          <h2>All Are Welcomed!!!</h2>
          <p>Hello everyone! Am Peter Simiyu, an upcoming software developer
             from <strong>Moringa School.</strong></p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Before joining <em>Moringa School,</em> I was a student of <strong>
            The University of Nairobi</strong>, <em>Kenya Science Campus.</em></p>
          <p>I got to this great school after I decided to follow my Dream of
             software developer. My passion happened to be in line with what I
             was assipiring to become, and so leaving UON for Moringa was
             just but the best option for me at that time.</p>

          <h2>My Life With Code.</h2>
          <p>I am a software developer from MORINGA SCHOOL - Kenya. I does coding as a <em>Job,
            hobby, making cartoon movies and for fun </em> Am passionate about buildiing codes
            and love them (codes). Programming is my no.1 profession because I enjoy going
            through smart web-pages, playing car racing video games and building them.</p>

          <h2>Best Sxhool</h2>
          <p>my best schools happens to be Mwiyenga Primary School which was my first school
             and <strong>Moringa School</strong>. Mwiyenga appears here because it made me
             feel good as a kid; enjoying the 'run-back-homes' and putting on the school uniforme
             are what made me feel like my real self</p>
          <h2>Entertainment</h2>
          <p>I love playing video games, watching movies and listening to music. My best video
             games are car rasing games with no specific game. playing these games makes me
             feel better when stressed or when just tired of thinking. They keeps my dream to
              build my on car racing video game alive.</p>

          <h2>Activities</h2>
          <p>Gaming could have been my best activies but I does it as part my
             entertainment. Though money is always is a factor and a problem for me, the best of all
             other activities remains touring the different parts of the <strong>Globe</strong>.
             Among others I like mountain climping basketball playing, swimming and many more. I firt
             joined mountain climpers in year 2014 during my tour to mt. Elgon. It was a dangerous journey
             to embark on considering the fact that I had not done mountain climping </p>
