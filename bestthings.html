    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="waka">hello everyone! my name is Peter Enock, I am student at the great <strong>Moringa School</strong>;- Kenya and also a student at

       before joining the above two schools, I went to <em>Mwiyenga Primary School</em> for nine years. after which I joined <em>Bishop
       Atundo boys high School</em>. Four years later, I completed my secondary School education. After a period of about three months, I joined
       African Insititute of Research and Development Study for a 1month course. Two years later, I was addimmited to <em>the University of
       Nairobi</em>. Now three years after, am at the great <strong>Moringa School</strong>.</p>
     <h2>School</h2>
     <p>my best schools happens to be Mwiyenga Primary School which was my first school and <strong>Moringa School</strong>. Mwiyenga appears here
       because it made me feel good as a kid; enjoying the 'run-back-homes' and putting on the school uniforme are what made me feel like my real
       self</p>
