    <h1>My best thihgs ever</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="waka">hello everyone! my name is Peter Enock, I am student at the great <strong>Moringa School</strong>;- Kenya and also a student at
       <em>the University of Nairobi</em>;- Kenya Science
       Campus<img src="images/kenya-science-campus.jpeg" alt="kenya science campus"><img src="images/ksc-airport.jpeg" alt="kenya science airport">
       before joining the above two schools, I went to <em>Mwiyenga Primary School</em> for nine years. after which I joined <em>Bishop
       Atundo boys high School</em>. Four years later, I completed my secondary School education. After a period of about three months, I joined
       African Insititute of Research and Development Study for a 1month course. Two years later, I was addimmited to <em>the University of
       Nairobi</em>. Now three years after, am at the great <strong>Moringa School</strong>.</p>
     <h2>School</h2>
     <p>my best schools happens to be Mwiyenga Primary School which was my first school and <strong>Moringa School</strong>. Mwiyenga appears here
       because it made me feel good as a kid; enjoying the 'run-back-homes' and putting on the school uniforme are what made me feel like my real
       self</p>
     <h2>Entertainment</h2>
     <p class="kwata">I love playing video games, watching movies and listening to music. My best video games are car rasing games with no specific game. playing
        these games makes me feel better when stressed or when just tired of thinking. They keeps my dream to build my on car racing video game
        alive.</p>
     <p class="kwata">When it comes to movies, I love most watching cartoons movies which I also desire so badly to make them; no wander coding is the best
        thing to learn and do. Nigerian movies, the commonly known as <strong>OGAH MOVIES</strong> are also good to watch for me since they reminds me of my past life and they gives me an
        opportunity to learn more and build on my <em>talend(acting) .</em>I mostly listen to music when I want to sleep for it makes it easy
        for me catch a sleep.</p>
